Project Title: Sales Price Prediction
In this project, I developed predictive models to estimate product sales based on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers. Using Python, I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature scaling. I implemented and compared two machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. Both models were trained on scaled data, and their performance was evaluated using test datasets. This project highlights my ability to analyze data, build regression models, and evaluate their accuracy for business decision-making.
