Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship - Project Summary

During my internship with Oasis Infobyte, I worked on five diverse and insightful data science projects that enhanced my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. These projects allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios, leveraging Python and various machine learning algorithms. Below is a summary of the projects I completed:

1. IRIS Flower Classification
Description:

I developed a machine learning model to classify different species of Iris flowers using the well-known Iris dataset. This project involved:

Data exploration to visualize relationships between features.
Feature correlation analysis using a heatmap.
Preprocessing the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and standardizing features.
Implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification based on sepal and petal characteristics.
Evaluating the model's performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
This project highlights my understanding of classification algorithms and model evaluation.

2. Unemployment Analysis
Description:

I analyzed unemployment trends across various states and regions using Python. The project included:

Data cleaning and transformation for consistency.
Descriptive statistical analysis and creation of visualizations (correlation heatmaps, box plots, animated bar charts, and sunburst charts).
Identification of patterns in unemployment rates and regional disparities.
This project demonstrates my expertise in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and interactive data visualization.

3. Car Price Prediction
Description:

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict car selling prices based on features such as fuel type, transmission, and car age. Key steps included:

Preprocessing the data by creating a new feature ("Car_Age") and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
Using the Random Forest Regressor to predict car prices based on the features.
Evaluating model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.
Saving the trained model for future predictions.
This project showcases my skills in regression techniques and model evaluation in predictive tasks.

4. Spam Detection System
Description:

I built a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or not spam (ham). The project involved:

Using TF-IDF vectorization to process text data.
Training a Naive Bayes classifier on the cleaned dataset.
Implementing a real-time spam detection system for dynamic predictions.
Saving the model and vectorizer for future use.
This project highlights my ability to apply NLP techniques and classification models to solve practical problems.

5. Sales Price Prediction
Description:

In this project, I developed models to predict product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, radio, and newspapers. The project included:

Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between variables.
Comparing two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluating model performance using test datasets.
This project emphasizes my ability to build and evaluate regression models for business analytics.

Conclusion

Throughout my internship, I gained valuable experience in applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems, from classification and regression to statistical analysis and data visualization. The skills and knowledge gained from these projects will serve as a solid foundation for my continued growth in the data science field.
