Project Title: IRIS Flower Classification
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify different species of Iris flowers using the popular Iris dataset. I performed data exploration, including visualizing relationships between features, and created a heatmap to understand feature correlations. After preparing the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and standardizing the features, I applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the flowers based on their physical characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, providing insights into its effectiveness. This project highlights my ability to implement classification algorithms and evaluate model performance.
