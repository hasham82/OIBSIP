Project Title: Car Price Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict car selling prices using various features like fuel type, transmission, and car age. The dataset was preprocessed by creating a new feature, "Car_Age," and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables. I used a Random Forest Regressor to model the relationship between the features and the selling price of the car. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score. The model was then saved for future use. This project demonstrates my ability to apply regression techniques and assess model performance in real-world scenarios.
